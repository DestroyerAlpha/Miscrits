All right, This is my first project, I mean first large project in python.
I Decided to start on my favourite game, and created a console version of it.
Run the main.py , not the game.py;

Version 1.0:
*You can see the backdrop of the story.
*Understand the game
*Catch miscrits(Currently limited to character B, will expand soon.)
*See all your caught miscrits.

Version 1.1:
*Added all the miscrits from the awakening patch





Guys tell me how it was. Waiting for your reply!
